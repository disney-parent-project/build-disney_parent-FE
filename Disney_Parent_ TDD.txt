Proposal
________________




- What problem does your app solve? 


This app will help find parents at the park allowing to swap childcare and stroller passes. This app will help enhance their Disney experience as parents by connecting with other parents, allowing them to go on all the 'big kid' rides together.


- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?


The app solves the problem for parents that need childcare and would like to go on rides. This gives the parents the help they need in order to be able to enjoy Disney rides as well.




- What is the mission statement?
With Disney Parent App you can find parents or locate one of our trusted child care organizations at the park to swap childcare or stroller passes with. Add some pixie dust to your Disney Experience by using the Disney Parent App and go on all the rides you've been missing out on!


Features
________________




- What features are required for your minimum viable product? 
1. An onboarding process for parents  
2. On-boarding process for a volunteer experienced business owner 
3. Ability to easily create and post a request (including meeting place/ride and time, and number of kids you have)  
4. Ability to easily edit/delete a question
5. Ability for anyone to easily search/find posted requests (filter by time, location place, general search)
6. Ability for a second parent user to log in and respond to the request


- What features may you wish to put in a future release? 
-Ability for parents to create an immediate request for wherever they are in the park. 
- Map feature that shows where you are and where your child is (how far the child is from the Parent) 


- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?




Frameworks - Libraries
________________




- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
1.UX = UX Power Tools, SketchApp Sources libraries
2. UI = FontAwesome
3. FE = style components, react pose
4. BE = Express, Knex, Nodemon, Bcryptjs, jsonwebtokens, Supertest,  Jest




- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?


- Are you required to pay to use the API?
N/A
- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
Maybe we can use Apple Frameworks in the future.


Target Audience
________________




- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
The app is targeting parents with children who do not reach ride height requirements.


- What feedback have you gotten from potential users? 
1. Would be cool if there was a background check (like Care.com) to make sure parents have safe backgrounds
2. Great as long as kids are doing something fun (going on rides, watching shows, playing in a childcare facility with other children) while the parents are riding.
      3. Worried about the safety of their children but the app is a good idea and could be of use to them. 


- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
We can try to validate the problem by having some users test the app.




Research
________________




- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.




Prototype Key Feature(s)
________________




- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
